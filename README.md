# payload_dumper
<!--
This was the **initial C prototype** of [payload-dumper-rust](https://github.com/rhythmcache/payload-dumper-rust). I originally started developing this tool in C but later migrated the project to Rust for better safety, maintainability, and performance.

This C version is now **completed for archival and comparison purposes**, but no longer actively maintained.
